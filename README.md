# set-a-function-to-be-executed-after-a-event-is-complete

You can set a function to be executed after a .trigger('click') event is complete in jQuery by chaining a .promise() method call after the trigger() call, followed by a .done() method call to specify the function to execute.

Here's an example:

```
$('#myButton').on('click', function() {
  console.log('Button clicked');
});

$('#myButton').trigger('click').promise().done(function() {
  console.log('Triggered click event completed');
});
```
In this example, we have a button with the ID myButton that has a click event handler attached to it. We then trigger a click event on this button using the trigger() method, and immediately chain a .promise() method call to get a promise object that represents the completion of the click event. Finally, we chain a .done() method call to specify the function to execute after the click event is complete. In this case, we're logging a message to the console indicating that the click event has completed.

Note that the .promise() method call is necessary to ensure that the function specified in .done() is executed only after the click event is complete. Without the .promise() call, the function may be executed before the click event is complete, leading to unexpected behavior.
